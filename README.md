conference-to-journal
=============

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'conference' with 'journal', instantly transforming any given academic conference into a journal.

Original idea by my colleague [Emma Tosch](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~etosch/), and original code by the fantastic [Cloud-to-Butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) plugin.
